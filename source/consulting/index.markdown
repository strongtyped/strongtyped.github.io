## Mentoring
<span class="strongtyped"><span class="strong">Strong</span><span class="typed">[Typed]</span></span> focuses on _how to get started developing and deploying reactive applications_ and _how to plan the introduction of reactive thinking_ in your organization. Furthermore we help you with _architecture_, _design_ and _code_ reviews.

## Development

We also help with the development of _application code_. Furthermore we help you with the _life cycle_ of your project, especially with the integration of the SBT and/or Activator tool with common product life cycle tools.
