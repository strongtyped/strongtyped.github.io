<h1> We are <a href="/"><span class="strong">Strong<span><span class="typed">[Typed]</span></a>!</h1>
We're very excited to announce that in conjunction with Typesafe, we are launching a new tool today: Go Typesafe.

BoldRadius has long been a strong proponent of Typesafe. As a trusted partner, we provide development, training and consulting services to accelerate the commercial adoption of Scala, Akka, and Play. In an effort to continue to foster this adoption, we've taken part in building Go Typesafe, a tool built to support organizations in adopting the Typesafe Reactive Platform.

After several conversations with early adopters, evangelists and change agents, we began to understand the challenges that come with trying to get buy-in and adoption of new technologies within organizations. It can be a long, and sometimes painful process. That's why, in conjunction with our friends at Typesafe, we've built Go Typesafe to help. Go Typesafe is focused on supporting internal development leaders and advocates for innovation. How? With tools to help you to demonstrate how the Typesafe Reactive Platform solves key challenges, backs them up with data and case studies, and helps guide how to successfully adopt it from a business perspective.

We're very excited to be helping more organizations take advantage of this game changing technology through this new tool.
