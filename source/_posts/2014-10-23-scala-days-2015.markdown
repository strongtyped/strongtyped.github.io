This blog post correponds to my 2015 Scala Days talk submission.

The content of this blog post (deliberately) does not really go into all details.

<!-- more -->

Content
-------

This blog post is about _modular programming_ in general,
and _modular programming with effects_ in particular.

The talk of Rúnar Bjarnason [_Composable application architecture with reasonably priced monads_](https://parleys.com/play/53a7d2c3e4b0543940d9e538/chapter0/about)
was also about modular programming with effects.

One of the motivations of this blog post is to build upon the ideas of Rúnar's talk to introduce some extra ideas.

For example:

* Rúnar's talk deals with _monadic_ computational features
* This blog post deals with both _monadic_ and _applicative_ computational features

Let's start with recapitulating some common concepts.

Product Type
------------

The code below defines _the product of types_

{% include_code ProductModule lang:scala ProductModule.scala %}

Sum Type
--------

The code below defines _the sum of types_

{% include_code SumModule lang:scala SumModule.scala %}

Sub Type
--------

The code below defines _subtypes_

{% include_code SubModule lang:scala SubModule.scala %}

Transformations
---------------

The code below defines _transformations_ and their relationship with _sums_

{% include_code TransformationModule lang:scala TransModule.scala %}


Computational Features
----------------------

The code below defines _computational features_ `res`, `and` and `bnd`

{% include_code ComputationalFeatures lang:scala ComputationalFeatures.scala %}

The new computational feature is the _applicative_ `and`.

Free
----

The code below defines _free computations_

{% include_code FreeModule lang:scala FreeModule.scala %}

Take your time to look at [_Rúnar's code_](https://gist.github.com/runarorama/a8fab38e473fafa0921d), line `30` to `49`,
and concentrate on both the (sometimes subtle) _differences_ and the _additions_.

Here are some things to concentrate on

* there are two case classes dealing with continuations
	* `And`, dealing with continuations of type `Free[F, X => Z]`
	* `Bnd`, dealing with continuations of type `X => Free[F, Z]`

* requirements are partitioned as requirements for `F` and requirements for `G`
	* the existence of `res` for `F` 
	* the existence of `and` and `bnd` for `G`

`Free[F, Z]` supports a _DSL for computations_ consisting of `res`, `and` and `bnd` (and also `end` which is defined in terms of `res`, `and` and `Result[F].res`).

Future
------

the `Future` type constructor will play the role of the `G` type constructor above.

The `Future[Z]` type we make use of is based upon the `SimpleJavaFuture[Z]` type which is a simple version of Java's `Future` type (ignoring capabilities like _cancellation_)

{% include_code Future lang:scala Future.scala %}

The only functionality you need to know about is `mkFuture`, somehow turning a block of code into a future (the implementation details are really not that important)

{% include_code mkFuture lang:scala mkFuture.scala %}

Futures are computations as implemented by `futureComputation` below

{% include_code futureComputation lang:scala futureComputation.scala %}

Here are some things to concentrate on

* `bnd` is implemented using _sequential execution_
* `and` is implemented using _parallel execution_

Id
--

the `Identity` type constructor will play the role of the `F` type constructor above (for `res`, and, therefore, also `end`)

{% include_code IdentityModule lang:scala IdentityModule.scala %}

the transformation makes use of `show` to show what is going on (see examples below)

Supplier
--------

the `Supplier` type constructor will play the role of the `F` type constructor above (for `and`, `bnd` and `supply`)

{% include_code SupplierModule lang:scala SupplierModule.scala %}

`Supplier` is a somewhat artificial _value supplier_ that, when transformed, incorporates both _latency_ and _verbosity_ (using `randomVerboseSleep` to show what is going on (see examples below)).

WithFile
--------

the `WithFile` type constructor will play the role of the `F` type constructor above (for `and`, `bnd` and `readFile`)

{% include_code WithFileModule lang:scala WithFileModule.scala %}

`WithFile` is a somewhat artificial _file manipulator_ that, when transforming, incorporates both _latency_ and _verbosity_ (using `randomVerboseSleep` to show what is going on (see examples below)).

Effect
------

The code below _assembles the effects_ we are going to use via the somewhat complex 
`({ type λ[ω] = Identity[ω] ++ Supplier[ω] ++ WithFile[ω] })#λ` type constructor that combines `Id`, `Supplier` and `WithFile`

{% include_code EffectModule lang:scala EffectModule.scala %}

So now we have a _DSL for computations with effects_

* the `and` and `bnd` computational features can be used
* the `res` (and, therefore, `end`) computational feature of `Identity` can be used
* the `supply` functionality of `Supplier` can be used
* the `readFile` functionality of `WithFile` can be used

Examples
--------

All examples below share the following code

{% include_code common lang:scala common.scala %}

I still have to change `javaOneUniversity` to `scalaDays`

`example01`
-----------

Here is a first example
 
{% include_code example01 lang:scala example01.scala %}

This example is _fully asysnc_ as demonstrated by the run session below

```

```

`example02`
-----------

Here is a second example illustrating _referential transparency_
 
{% include_code example02 lang:scala example02.scala %}

This example is _fully asysnc_ as demonstrated by the run session below

```

```

`example03`
-----------

Here is a third example
 
{% include_code example03 lang:scala example03.scala %}

This example is _not fully asysnc_ any more as demonstrated by the run session below (see lines `14` to `19` and line `34`)

```

```

`example04`
-----------

Here is a fourth example, where the second file to be read is determined by the content of the first file to be read
 
{% include_code example04 lang:scala example04.scala %}

This example is _not fully asysnc_ any more as demonstrated by the run session below (see lines `14` to `19`, lines `20` to `25` and line `34`)
